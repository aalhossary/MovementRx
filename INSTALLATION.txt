To install as a separate application,

1) First install the required libraries:
- Python 3.8 (3.7 should work but I did not try it)
- matplotlib 3.3.2
- numpy 1.19
- pyqt 5.9
- scipy 1.5 (required by spm1d (included a modified version within the code here))

2) Navigate to the project root directory
cd MovementRx

3) Remember to add the project root to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
e.g. anaconda prompt, you can write
set PYTHONPATH=.
(please change this according to your environment)

4) Launch the application
python spmclient/app.py
